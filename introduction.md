**NMAP Introduction**
**NMAP** is a network mapper
It is an open source linux command line tool used to scan IP addresses and ports in a network to detect installed applications
It allows network admmins to find which devices are running on their network, discover open ports and services and detect vulnerabilities.

**Features of NMAP**
1. Helps in mapping out a network without sophisticated commands or configurations
2. It supports simple commands and complex scripting through Nmap Scripting engine.
3. Quickly recognizes all the devices on single or multiple networks.
4. Helps identify services running on a system.
5. Detects application versions with accuracy to help detect vulnerabilities
6. Helps find information of OS running on devices
7. Can be used to attack systems using existing scripts from nmap script engine
8. It has a GUI called Zenmap, that helps develop visual mappings of a network for better usability and reporting

**Port Scan**
It is a technique that hackers use o discover open doors or weak points in a network
Port scan attack helps cyber criminals find open ports and figure out whether they are receiving or sending data.
It can reveal whether active security devices are being used by an organization e.g. firewall
It can be used by businesses to send packets to specific ports and analyze responses for potential vulnerabilities.

Port scanning can give information such as:
. Services that are running
. Users who own services
. Whether anonymous logins are allowed
. Which network services require authentication

**Port Scanning techniques**
1. **Ping Scan**:
2. **Vanilla scan**:
3. **SYN Scan**
4. **XMAS and FIN scan**: 
5. **FTP bounce scan**:
6. **Sweep Scan**
